								<h2>IDEA About DR Search</h2>
								<p>
                                The purpose of the project entitled as “DR. SEARCH” is to computerize the enquiry of various medical services to develop software which is user friendly simple, fast, and cost effective. It deals with the collection of Doctor’s information, Diagnosis details, blood banks and Hospitals details etc. 
                                Traditionally, it was done manually. The main function of the system is to provide patients a flexible system for hospital details, Blood bank details etc. and retrieve these details as and when required, and also to manipulate these details meaningfully System input contains doctor details, diagnosis details, while system output is to get these details on to the screen.
                               </p><p> The project “DR. SEARCH” can be entered without any password systems for enquiry and appointment purposes, to manipulate the server data using a username and password. It is accessible by an administrator. Only he/she can add data into the database. The data can be retrieved easily. The data are well protected for personal use and makes the data processing very fast.

									<h3>About Us</h3>
									<p>The idea of DR SEARCH project was initially thought and implemented by Diploma in computer engineering students from Govt. polytechnic college MASAB TANK(GPT). it was initially planned and devoloped by jai chandrakanth reddy the team head and cheif developer of DR search based on suggestion given by T.s moses with partially gathered resources.
                                    </p><p>later development and actual work on project started on 25DEC2016 with designing basic UI(user interfaces) through HTML5,CSS3 and JAVASCRIPT.in early january it was finalised that there are a total of 10 modules included in the project.
									 In early february k.saivardhan contributed his suggestions and guidance on PHP database connectivity of DR search and later it was finalised that xampp server and PHP myAdmin would serve as front end and background deployment softwares respectively.As per the sources the progress of project was about 60% completed,including HOME, DOCTORS, HOSPITALS, APPOINTMENTS, BLOODBANK, EMERGENCY DIALS modules.</p>
									<p>In mid february M.srikanth reddy also suggested about the CSS breifing of the UI. <br>As of late february the progress of Dr search was completed by 90% excluding two modules.later one of the two unfinished modules(pharmacy) was opted out citing date issues in completion of it.On 3march2017 DRSEARCH was first premiered in GPT masab tank.</p>
